> - MLP, following [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf)
> - CNN, following DeepMind WaveNet 2016 (in progress...)
> - RNN, following Mikolov et al. 2010
> - LSTM, following Graves et al. 2014
> - GRU, following Kyunghyun Cho et al. 2014
> - Transformer, following Vaswani et al. 2017
